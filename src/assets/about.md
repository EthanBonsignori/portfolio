I'm a self-taught **Web Developer** based out of Atlanta, GA. I've been creating apps and websites for 2 years and enjoy learning new technologies and frameworks. Prior to becoming a developer, I taught myself tools like Photoshop and Illustrator and did freelance graphic design. You can see some of my previous work on <a href='https://ethanbon.com/design' title='Design Portfolio'>my design portfolio</a>. I fell in love both the design and problem solving aspects of web development and my unique background of graphic design and IT mesh perfectly for the role. Currently I am building apps with JavaScript frameworks like **React** and **Node.js** and writing technical guides over <a href='https://ethanbon.com/blog' title='My Blog'>on my blog</a>. _Thanks for stopping by!_
