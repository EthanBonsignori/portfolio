I'm a full-stack **Software Engineer**. I love learning and all things web. Currently I am building apps with JavaScript frameworks like **React** and **Node.js** fulltime and working on <a href='https://ethanbon.com./projects' title='Projects'>projects</a> on the side. Occasionally I write stuff <a href='https://ethanbon.com/blog' title='My Blog'>on my blog</a>. Prior to becoming a software engineer, I taught myself tools like Photoshop and Illustrator and did freelance graphic design. You can see some of my previous design work on <a href='https://ethanbon.com/design' title='Design Portfolio'>my design portfolio</a>. _Thanks for stopping by!_
