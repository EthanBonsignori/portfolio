Daily Chart started as a way to track phone calls I was making each day during a certain global pandemic. I wanted it to be universal and customizable for other purposes, so I converted it to React, added settings, and a nice UI so that anyone could use it. Why? To track occurrences of just about anything over a day and see that data in a nice graph! You can look at that data in bar-graph form over the past 7 or 30 days too, with optional weekend dates! I had fun learning a lot about Electron while creating this app.
