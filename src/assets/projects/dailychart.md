Daily Chart started as a way to track phone calls I was making each day during a certain global pandemic. It was a quick 1-day project written with just Javascript and Electron, but I wanted it to be customizable for other purposes. I spent a few days converting it to React, added settings, and a nice UI so that anyone could use it. Why use it? To track occurrences of just about anything over a day and see your data displayed in a nice graph! You can look at that data in bar-graph form over the past 7 or 30 days too, with plenty of options. This was a great quick project to learn about Electron.
