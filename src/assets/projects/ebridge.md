eBridge is my most ambitious project to date and still very much a work in progress.
I created it to provide a platform for free online contract bridge after pogo shut down its (rather old) free bridge app around June 2019. As it turns out, a site with a host of social and multiplayer-game features can be quite complex! My goal is to have chat rooms, a friends list, player-rankings, instant game matchmaking, and custom profiles. A lot of these features are still in the works, however. 

When I began eBridge, I wanted to incorporate all of the best frameworks and technology I'd used in previous projects. It's built on Next.js and React for amazing Server-Side Rendering. I also taught myself React Hooks and Redux while creating the front end for this project. The form state, validation, user login and more are handled through Redux. I also to push myself to learn new technologies while creating eBridge. The chat is made with socket.io, and I've added working user uploaded profile pictures that can be cropped. The pictures are stored in Digital Ocean Spaces (equivalent to Amazon's S3). The next planned feature is the game-logic and rooms, so keep an eye out!
