cReddit is an app that seeks to clone (new) reddit's homepage, the main purpose being learning new frameworks along the way. While creating cReddit, I am teaching myself Typescript, GraphQL, Typeorm, Apollo, Chakra UI, and more. It's a sort of trial by fire! Currently you can find the repo for the code above, as it is not deployed yet, but it will be in the very near future.

Check back soon for screenshots and a deployed site.
