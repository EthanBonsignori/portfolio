cReddit is a reddit clone app I am building to learn many new frameworks. I am teaching myself Typescript, GraphQL, Typeorm, Apollo, Chakra UI, and more with this app. It's sort of a trial by fire! Currently you can find the repo for the code above, as it is not deployed yet, but it will be in the very near future!

Check back soon for screenshots and a deployed site.
