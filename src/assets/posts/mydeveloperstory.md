I wanted to share a small but important ongoing piece of my story. My process of becoming a developer, the help I had along the way, and my outlook going forward. I tried to write this post as more of an entertaining story than a technical piece about code. I plan publish more technical blog posts soon—stay tuned.

> **[boot camp](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/boot%20camp)** *noun* : a place or undertaking that resembles a military boot camp especially by requiring one to endure intensive training or initiation

For those unaware, over the past decade or so the *web development boot camp* (henceforth just *boot camp*) has become a rather popular way for institutes and businesses to turn people with little to no coding skills into work–ready web developers for a small fee ranging anywhere from $5,000 to $20,000. People (like me) sign up with the promise of landing an awesome developer job after a relatively short time investment, usually 6 months. [Their efficacy is debated](https://www.forbes.com/sites/aswinpranam/2020/02/22/the-case-against-ai-ux-and-coding-bootcamps/), but I'll hold my thoughts, suffice to say—apart from a bit of luck in the beginning of my journey—a global pandemic combined with record unemployment has hindered my plans a bit. That is not to say, however, that I think attending my boot camp was a mistake. In fact, I think signing up was one of the best choices I've made. Looking back, I think of my life as two distinct periods now; pre and post boot camp. It was a major turning point for me. Not just in terms of career prospects, but overall outlook on life.

##### January, 2019
It was around the 15th performance of *Annie* when I decided it was time for a change. I sat behind the light board clicking its 'GO' button on cue as each scene began, switched, or ended. The same as I had for each prior performance and hundreds if not thousands of other shows before it. It wasn't a bad show by any means, but there certainly wasn't a whole lot going on in terms of *lightning action*. So as I hit 'GO' and sat waiting the several minute span before I knew I'd have to hit my next cue, something finally switched inside my head. I was nearing 5 years of working for community and local theatre. Jobs that didn't hold the kind of secure future I was looking for, despite being great fun. I remembered seeing an ad for a fullstack web development boot camp offered by Georgia Tech. I made several attempts to teach myself to code over the course of my life, none succeeding, and it was always a skill that interested me. So, with the sound of kids belting *It's the Hard Knock Life, for us!* and the band drumming along—I picked up my phone and navigated to the site feeling ready to take a leap.

The first day (and honestly the entire 6 months) of boot camp went by very quickly. We played some icebreaker games and went over the structure of the boot camp. It was simple:
* Learn new major concepts in class when we met three times a week: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Databases, and so on.
* Complete weekly assigned projects outside of class utilizing whatever new subject we were learning.

These projects quickly became the main source of my learning because of how limited the in-class time was. Each project was a homework assignment with specific requirements. I tried to go above and beyond those requirements each time to learn all I could. I treated each one like a new learning experience and dove head-first into learning each new skill. I was fortunate to have the job I did that allowed me to spend much of my time coding, learning, and growing.

I started reading some motivational books like *[Malcolm Gladwell's Outliers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_(book))*, began going on daily walks, and spent less time on bad habits like video-gaming. I had a newfound confidence. With each in-class exercise that I finished in half the alloted time; with each new project that I knew at the onset I could handle; I felt that confidence grow. My classmates asked me questions when our teacher was busy with something else. The teacher started adding extra requirements to some in-class activities and projects to challenge me. People jokingly called me *the genius* when I walked in, which made me want to hide in a corner, but it was nice to see my hard work paying off. And while there was online tutoring offered by the boot camp, I got a number of requests from classmates to meet for coffee to help them outside of class, one of which ultimately lead to a job.

Graduation day was finally here, accompanied by our nervous excitement as my classmates and I presented our final projects before an audience of our relatives and peers. My project was a neat Journal/Contact hybrid that was a little too ambitious for the three-week time frame we had to complete them, but I was proud of the result. I got a special mention for perfect attendance, something to this day I don't know how I managed (my attendance in grade school was abysmal). The head of the boot camp gave a motivating speech along with a representative from Georgia Tech. We got our certificates and mingled for a bit before hauling them home.

About a week later when I was visiting Atlanta to interview for jobs and I got an email from one of my former classmates. It was a job offer! He wanted me to come be a web developer at the company at which he was the COO of. I graciously accepted after some negotiations and made my way back to Savannah, hopeful for my future. I spent a short 9 months working there before COVID hit. Unfortunately, we ended up having a few disagreements over COVID safety measures, and I ended up leaving. But I look back fondly on my first developer job, and am doing everything in my power to land the next one.
