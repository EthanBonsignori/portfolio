It's funny how time alters our perception of the past. When I look back on my life I almost group it into two categories; pre and post bootcamp. Sure there are many other defining moments—firsts and lasts I'll remember forever—but the bootcamp was really a turning point for me. Not just in terms of job prospects, but overall outlook on life.

It was around the 15th performance of <i>Annie</i> when I decided it was time for a change. I sat behind the lightboard clicking its 'GO' button on cue as each scene began, switched, or ended. Same as I had for each performance prior and hundreds if not thousands of other shows before it. It wasn't a bad show by any means, but there certainly wasn't a lot going on in terms of <i>lightning action</i>. So as I hit GO and sat waiting the several minute span before I knew I'd have to hit my next cue, something finally switched inside my head. I was nearing 5 years of working for community and local theatre. Jobs that, despite being great fun, didn't promise the secure future I wanted out of life. I had plenty of freedom, but I wasn't creatively fulfilled and never felt challenged. I did some freelance design work on the side, but that never fully grasped me like I wanted out of a career. I remembered seeing an ad for a Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp offered by Georgia Tech. I had tried to teach myself to code several times over the course of my life and it was always a skill that interested me. So, with the sound of kids belting <i>It's the Hard Knock Life, for us!</i> and the band drumming along, I picked up my phone and navigated to the site feeling ready to take a leap.

The first day of Bootcamp went by very quickly. We played ice-breaker games and went over the structure of the bootcamp. It was quite simple; learn new major concepts in class when we met three times a week; spend several hours outside of class working on homework projects to dive into those skills on our own. These projects were the major source of our learning because of how limited both our in-class time was and the length of the bootcamp itself (just 6 months!). As much as I'd like to, I won't go over every project I did in the bootcamp. Each project I tried to go above and beyond the requirements for and by the end each felt like its own special creation (that I loved looking back on while writing this). I was fortunate to have the job I did at the time that allowed me most of my day to spend coding and learning. And coding and learning I did...

Our first project was to make a [portfolio site](https://ethanbonsignori.github.io/Basic-Portfolio/index.html) with fake project links because... well, we hadn't done any other projects yet. Over the course of the bootcamp we recreated [our portfolios when we picked up Bootstrap CSS](https://ethanbonsignori.github.io/Bootstrap-Portfolio/index.html) and again when [we learned how to make our sites mobile responsive](https://ethanbonsignori.github.io/Responsive-Portfolio/index.html). I wrote [more about my past portfolios here](https://ethanbon.com/blog/lookingbackatpastportfolios). At this point we had only begun to learn HTML and CSS but I could already tell I loved web development. It combined the creativity I enjoyed from graphic design with the structure of HTML and CSS to back it up. The only thing missing was Javascript...

My [first javascript projects](https://ethanbonsignori.github.io/Bootstrap-Portfolio/portfolio.html) were quite simple and I could tell there was a lot I still needed to learn. But I was hooked. One of our first projects was to create a [simple RPG style game](https://ethanbonsignori.github.io/unit-4-game/) that I added a <i>Winnie the Pooh</i> theme to, images and animations, some flavor text. I was spending all my free time coding these projects and it began to show in class. If our instructor was busy I often had other members of class asking for my assistance with their projects or in class exerices. At one point the instructor was sending me harder versions of those exercises and giving me extra requirements on projects because I would be done before everyone else. I truly don't like to brag, but I was feeling very confident at the time about my newfound skillset. Of course I had help along the way. I am fortunate enough to have a brother that is also a web developer I could bounce ideas and questions off of. Combined with my past of growing up along side the internet, I had a few priveleges that not everyone else had in class.

We went on to learn about databases, SQL and MongoDB.
