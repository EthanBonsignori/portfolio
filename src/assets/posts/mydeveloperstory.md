I wanted to share a small but important ongoing piece of my story. My process of becoming a developer, the help I had along the way, and my outlook going forward. I tried to write this post as more of an entertaining story than a technical piece about code. I plan publish more technical blog posts soon—stay tuned.

> **[boot camp](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/boot%20camp)** *noun* : a place or undertaking that resembles a military boot camp especially by requiring one to endure intensive training or initiation

For those unaware, over the past decade or so the *web development boot camp* (henceforth just *boot camp*) has become a rather popular way for institutes and businesses to churn out work–ready web developers in a short time frame for a small fee ranging anywhere from $5,000 to $20,000. People (like me) sign up with the promise of landing an awesome developer job after a relatively short time investment. [Their efficacy is debated](https://www.forbes.com/sites/aswinpranam/2020/02/22/the-case-against-ai-ux-and-coding-bootcamps/), but I'll hold my thoughts, suffice to say—apart from a bit of luck in the beginning of my journey—a global pandemic combined with record unemployment has hindered my plans a bit. That is not to say, however, that I think attending my bootcamp was a mistake. In fact, I think signing up was one of the best choices I've made. I almost group my life into two categories now; pre and post boot camp. It was a major turning point for me. Not just in terms of career prospects, but overall outlook on life.

##### January, 2019
It was around the 15th performance of *Annie* when I decided it was time for a change. I sat behind the lightboard clicking its 'GO' button on cue as each scene began, switched, or ended. Same as I had for each performance prior and hundreds if not thousands of other shows before it. It wasn't a bad show by any means, but there certainly wasn't a lot going on in terms of *lightning action*. So as I hit GO and sat waiting the several minute span before I knew I'd have to hit my next cue, something finally switched inside my head. I was nearing 5 years of working for community and local theatre. Jobs that, despite being great fun, didn't promise the secure future I wanted out of life. I had plenty of freedom, but I wasn't creatively fulfilled and never felt challenged. I did some freelance design work on the side, but that never fully grasped me like I wanted out of a career. I remembered seeing an ad for a fullstack boot camp offered by Georgia Tech. I had tried to teach myself to code several times over the course of my life and it was always a skill that interested me. So, with the sound of kids belting *It's the Hard Knock Life, for us!* and the band drumming along—I picked up my phone and navigated to the site feeling ready to take a leap.

The first day (and honestly the entire 6 months) of Bootcamp went by very quickly. We played some icebreaker games and went over the structure of the bootcamp. It was quite simple; learn new major concepts in class when we met three times a week; spend several hours outside of class working on homework projects to dive into those skills on our own. These projects were the major source of our learning because of how limited our in-class time was. With each project, I tried to go above and beyond the requirements to learn all I could. Each felt like its own special creation (that I loved looking back on while writing this). I was fortunate to have the job I did at the time that allowed me most of my day to spend coding and learning. And coding and learning I did...
