I wanted to share a small but important ongoing piece of my story. My process of becoming a developer, the help I had along the way, and my outlook going forward. I tried to write this post as more of an entertaining story than a technical piece about code. I plan to publish more technical blog posts soon—stay tuned.

> **[boot camp](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/boot%20camp)** *noun* : a place or undertaking that resembles a military boot camp especially by requiring one to endure intensive training or initiation

For those unaware, over the past decade or so the *web development boot camp* (henceforth just *boot camp*) has become a rather popular way for institutes and businesses to turn people with little to no coding skills into work–ready web developers for a small fee ranging anywhere from $5,000 to $20,000. People (like me) sign up with the promise of landing an awesome developer job after a relatively short time investment, usually 6 months. [Their efficacy is debated](https://www.forbes.com/sites/aswinpranam/2020/02/22/the-case-against-ai-ux-and-coding-bootcamps/), but I'll hold my thoughts, suffice to say—apart from a bit of luck in the beginning of my journey—a global pandemic combined with record unemployment has hindered my plans a bit. That is not to say, however, that I think attending my boot camp was a mistake. In fact, I think signing up was one of the best choices I've made. Looking back, I think of my life as two distinct periods now; pre and post boot camp. It was a major turning point for me. Not just in terms of career prospects, but overall outlook on life.

##### January, 2019
It was around the 15th performance of *Annie* when I decided it was time for a change. I sat behind the light board clicking its 'GO' button on cue as each scene began, switched, or ended. The same as I had for each prior performance and hundreds if not thousands of other shows before it. It wasn't a bad show by any means, but there certainly wasn't a whole lot going on in terms of *lightning action*. So as I hit 'GO' and sat waiting the several minute span before I knew I'd have to hit my next cue, something finally switched inside my head. I was nearing 5 years of working for community and local theatre. Jobs that didn't hold the kind of secure future I was looking for, despite being great fun. I remembered seeing an ad for a fullstack web development boot camp offered by Georgia Tech. I made several attempts to teach myself to code over the course of my life, none succeeding, and it was always a skill that interested me. So, with the sound of kids belting *It's the Hard Knock Life, for us!* and the band drumming along—I picked up my phone and navigated to the site feeling ready to take a leap.

The first day (and honestly the entire 6 months) of boot camp went by very quickly. We played some icebreaker games and went over the structure of the boot camp. It was simple:
* Learn new major concepts in class when we met three times a week: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Databases, and so on.
* Complete weekly assigned projects outside of class utilizing whatever new subject we were learning.

These projects quickly became the main source of my learning because of how limited the in-class time was. Each project was a homework assignment with specific requirements that I tried to go above and beyond to learn as much as I could. I treated each set of requirements like a new learning experience and dove head-first into exploring each new skill until I felt I had a grasp on it. I was fortunate to have the job I did that allowed me to spend much of my time coding, learning, and growing. And I was fortunate to have a brother who works as a software engineer. I could constantly barrage him with any coding problem I was currently stuck on and get a detailed response. These were invaluable assets to me during the boot camp, but I can't give away all the credit to outside forces!

I started reading some motivational books like *[Malcolm Gladwell's Outliers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_(book))*, began going on daily walks, and spent less time on bad habits like video-gaming. I had a newfound confidence. With each in-class exercise that I finished in a fraction of the alloted time; with each project that I knew at the onset I could handle; I felt that confidence grow. My classmates started asking me questions when our teacher was busy with something else. Our teacher started adding extra requirements to some in-class activities and projects specifically to challenge me. People jokingly called me *the genius* when I walked in, which always gave me a sense of imposter syndrome, but it was nice to see my hard work paying off. And while there was online tutoring offered by the boot camp, I got a number of requests from classmates to meet for coffee to help them outside of class, one of which ultimately lead to a job.

##### August, 2019
Graduation day was here, accompanied by our nervous excitement as my classmates and I presented our final projects before an audience of our relatives and peers. My project was a neat Journal/Contact hybrid that was a little too ambitious for the three-week time frame we had to complete them, but I was proud of the result. I got a special mention for perfect attendance, something to this day I don't know how I managed (my attendance in grade school was abysmal). The head of the boot camp gave a motivating speech along with a representative from Georgia Tech. We got our certificates and mingled for a bit before hauling them home.

About a week later, I was visiting Atlanta to interview for jobs when I got an email from one of my former classmates. It was a job offer! He wanted me to come be a web developer at the company at which he was the COO of. I graciously accepted after some negotiations and made my way back to Savannah, hopeful for the future. I spent 9 months working there before the COVID pandemic. I didn't feel safe about their lack of COVID precautions and ended up leaving in May of 2020.

##### Present Day, Current Year
As of today, I'm back in Atlanta where I work on projects to hone my existing web development skills and acquire new ones. My plan, as of March, 2021, is to learn new frameworks like GraphQL, Apollo, React Native, Docker, and others through projects just like I did in boot camp. Be sure to check out [my projects page](https://ethanbon.com/projects) to see what I've been up to lately. I also plan to continue working on this site, writing blogs and adding projects periodically whilst applying for jobs. Of course, there's a chance you are reading this sometime in the far future, in which case: I definitely landed that awesome developer job and am probably meditating, sleeping, or coding at this very moment.

Thank you for taking the time to read about this small part of my story. Be sure to click the heart if you enjoyed it. Feel free to [get in touch](https://ethanbon.com/contact) if you have any questions, comments, concerns, if you think this blog was nice, didn't like it, or honestly any reason you want—I'd love to hear from you.
